# Two_Dust_Disks

A Python project that uses survey data from LAMOST DR7, APOGEE DR17, and Gaia DR3 to investigate the dust disk of the Milky Way. We identified two components: the thick disk and the thin disk, and precisely measured their scale height, scale length, dust mass, and gas-to-dust ratio parameters. 

The first authors of this project are Ruoyi Zhang and Haibo Yuan. This project provides the source code, some raw data, and data outputs, as well as the figures from the paper. The corresponding academic paper is currently under review.

# Two_Dust_Disks

A Python project that uses survey data from LAMOST DR7, APOGEE DR17, and Gaia DR3 to investigate the dust disk of the Milky Way. We identified two components: the thick disk and the thin disk, and precisely measured their scale height, scale length, dust mass, and gas-to-dust ratio parameters. 

This project provides the source code for the study, as well as a subset of the data with smaller space requirements, and presents the results in the form of images. The corresponding academic paper is currently under review.
